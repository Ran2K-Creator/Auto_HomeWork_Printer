# Auto_HomeWork_Printer
Python program that automates the boring process of answering and writing the homework.
It uses AI to generate the text, and creates a .gcode file from the generated text, so you can print it in your notebook!







<b>--> To set up the program, make sure you have a 3D-Printer that supports .gcode(sliced) files, Chrome and Firefox browsers, and a notebook.</b>

<b>--> Note that you will need to install the following libraries -> Selenium, pyChatGPT</b>

<b>--> Now you're finally, ready to go!</b>

<b>--> Visit the installation guide in the main menu of this repo</b>
